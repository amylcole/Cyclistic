This is my first readme. 
This is my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. 
I undertook this project to learn more about the discipline of data analytics. 
I used it to learn how to work through a case study in R, document it in Quarto and push it to Github. 
I made many beginner mistakes. This created the opportunity to learn about how to commit changes to a Github repo. 
To view the Quarto doc as rendered HTML in a browser, prepend the following string to its URL: https://previewhtml.github.io/?
